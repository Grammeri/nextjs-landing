This standard applies only to system-level internal developer documentation that defines contracts, policies, architecture, and invariant workflows. These documents are read in the IDE.

This standard does not apply to public documentation, marketing content, or onboarding guides.

## Scope

This standard applies only to system-level internal developer documentation.

System-level documents define contracts, policies, architecture, and invariant workflows.

This standard is the base reference for all internal documentation standards.

Other internal document types (developer guides, workflows, how-to documents)
may follow additional or extended standards, but must not contradict this one.

This document follows its own rules.

## Heading hierarchy

Requirements are mandatory. Use exactly one `#` heading per file. Use `##` for main sections. Use `###` only for actionable steps. Do not skip heading levels.

## Horizontal rules

Horizontal rules are allowed only as major semantic separators. Use one empty line before and after `---`. Do not place `---` directly next to text or headings. Do not insert `---` after every section.

## Emoji usage

Emoji are not allowed in system-level developer documentation.

Developer guides and workflow documents may allow emoji if explicitly permitted by their own standard.

In case of conflict, this standard takes precedence. The absence of `###` headings in a document is valid
if no actionable steps are defined.

## Lists

Use lists only for real enumerations. Do not use lists for prose.

## Code blocks

Always use fenced code blocks. Always add a language tag when applicable. Commands must be copy-safe.

## Tone

The tone must be neutral, technical, and system-oriented. Marketing language, hype, and rhetorical phrases are not allowed.

## Separation rule

Sections must be visually separated with spacing, and dense blocks without spacing are not allowed.
